## Moove - A Micromobility Project

Moove is a **leading shared micromobility company**, offering transportation solutions in more than twenty cities across Europe. The main micromobility options include bicycles, bikes, and scooters, all of which are electric.

Moove started from a simple need: providing access to an alternative type of transport to move around cities easily and instantly.

## Our Vision

We aim to promote **sustainable mobility** in big cities, making transportation more environmentally friendly and accessible for citizens.

## Project Code

In this project, I used TypeScript to write interfaces and classes for transports, **users, and cities**.

These instances interact with each other, allowing users to book transports and add new transport options to different cities.

## How to Use It

Clone the code and start creating instances from classes. You can create users with their own information, choose the cities where the service is available, and add new types of transport.

Then, you can use the methods provided to book transports and manage their movement within the cities you selected.

The instances you create can be used throughout the code as variables to build a functional application.
